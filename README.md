#### [Author : Yassine Sfaihi]
## Introduction:
The Social Media Analytics Pipeline project aims to extract data from Instagram and Facebook based on specific search topics and store them in a MongoDB database. The project includes two parts, which involve using different tools and libraries to extract data from both social media platforms.

## Part 1: Instagram Data Extraction
The first part of the project involves using the Instagrapi Python library to extract Instagram posts and comments related to a given search topic. Instagrapi is a lightweight and powerful Python wrapper for the Instagram Private API. The API allows for the extraction of a wide range of Instagram data, including posts, comments, stories, and more. The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database for further analysis. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows for the storage and retrieval of unstructured data.

To extract data using Instagrapi, we need to provide our Instagram username and password. We can then use the Instagrapi API to search for posts and comments related to a given topic. We can also specify other search parameters, such as the number of posts to extract, the language of the posts, and the date range of the posts.

### Tools used: Python, Instagrapi, MongoDB

## Part 2: Facebook Data Extraction
The second part of the project involves using the Facebook Graph API to extract public posts and comments related to a given search topic. The Facebook Graph API is a powerful tool for accessing and analyzing Facebook data. It allows for the extraction of a wide range of data, including posts, comments, reactions, and more.

To extract data using the Facebook Graph API, we need to create a Facebook App and obtain an access token. We can then use the API to search for public posts and comments related to a given topic. We can also specify other search parameters, such as the date range of the posts, the language of the posts, and the type of posts to extract.

The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database for further analysis. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows for the storage and retrieval of unstructured data.

### Tools used: Python, Facebook Graph API, MongoDB

## Conclusion:
The Social Media Analytics Pipeline project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, data extraction, and database management. By extracting data from both Instagram and Facebook, we can gain insights into how people are talking about specific topics on social media. We can use this data to inform marketing strategies, social media campaigns, and more. The project also highlights the importance of using the right tools and libraries for data extraction and management.
